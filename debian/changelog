  * Mark entire conversations as read.
  * Allow pass multiple fields on sort clause.
  * Reduce the dbus traffic when marking messages and threads as read.
  * Use a QLockFile to ensure there will be only one instance of the daemon per user. As we now delay the registration on dbus, sometimes we ended up having two instances of the daeon running (because of dbus activation). This change makes sure that won't happen.
  * Do not load the participants from threads automatically. If the client really needs it, it can use the newly added API to fetch the participants.
  * Make it possible to debug sqlite commands.
